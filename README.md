Some todo:

- [x] Revert the `margin: auto` for `row` class on mobile devices which I did back in early days.

Random notes:

- Border radius: when setting `overflow: hidden` on parent element, the iOS sometimes
    does not respect it. I found a cool workaround [here](https://forum.webflow.com/t/safari-not-hiding-overflow-on-rounded-corner-divs/55060/2).
